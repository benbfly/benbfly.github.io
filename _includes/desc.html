We develop computational tools to understand and analyze the patterns of DNA methylation present in the human genome. These patterns present themselves at different genomic scales, from individual protein binding sites (top, IGV) to nucleosomal arrays (middle, XX) to large chromosomal domains (bottom, XXX).
