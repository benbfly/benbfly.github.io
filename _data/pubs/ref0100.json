We recently demonstrated ONT shallow whole-genome sequencing to detect copy number alterations (CNAs) from the circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) of cancer patients. Here, we show that cell type and cancer-specific methylation changes can also be detected, as well as cancer-associated fragmentation signatures. This feasibility study suggests that ONT shallow WGS could be a powerful tool for liquid biopsy.<\/jats:p>\n                <jats:p><jats:bold>Graphical Abstract<\/jats:bold><\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1186\/s13059-022-02710-1","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,15]],"date-time":"2022-07-15T08:02:54Z","timestamp":1657872174000},"update-policy":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/springer_crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":"Detecting cell-of-origin and cancer-specific methylation features of cell-free DNA from Nanopore sequencing","prefix":"10.1186","volume":"23","author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-4897-8783","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Efrat","family":"Katsman","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-4739-6113","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Shari","family":"Orlanski","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-7564-9224","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Filippo","family":"Martignano","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-3773-9330","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Ilana","family":"Fox-Fisher","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-0625-475X","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Ruth","family":"Shemer","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2456-2289","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Yuval","family":"Dor","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-5077-9249","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Aviad","family":"Zick","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-9121-6258","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Amir","family":"Eden","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-7752-6866","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Iacopo","family":"Petrini","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-4244-1846","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Silvestro G.","family":"Conticello","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-2099-9005","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Benjamin P.","family":"Berman","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"297","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,15]]},"reference":[{"key":"2710_CR1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","unstructured":"Lo YMD, Han DSC, Jiang P, Chiu RWK.
