Our lab is interested in the reconstruction of cancer gene regulatory networks from DNA methylation and other chromatin changes that occur at transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs). For instance, we collaborated with Peter Jonesâ€™ lab to develop the multi-omic NOMe-seq technique for determining the differing roles of DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility at TFBSs (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.143008.112" target="_blank">Kelly et al., <em>Genome Res.</em> 2010</a>), and developed a computational approach Bis-SNP to deconvolute methylation and SNP information from bisulfite sequencing to identify allele-specific TFBSs (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/gb-2012-13-7-r61" target="_blank">Liu et al., <em>Genome Biol.</em> 2012</a>). We developed a Bioconductor R package, ELMER, that integrates DNA methylation information at TFBSs with TF expression levels to reconstruct gene regulatory networks (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-015-0668-3" target="_blank">Yao et al., <em>Genome Biol.</em> 2015</a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty902" target="_blank">Silva et al., <em>Bioinformatics</em> 2018</a>).
