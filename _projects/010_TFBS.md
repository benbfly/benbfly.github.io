We collaborated with Peter Jonesâ€™ lab to develop the multi-omic NOMe-seq technique for determining the differing roles of DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility at TFBSs (Kelly et al., 2012), and developed a computational approach Bis-SNP to deconvolute methylation and SNP information from methylation sequencing data to identify allele-specific TFBSs (Liu et al., 2012). We devised a method using DNA methylation and expression data to reconstruct entire gene regulatory networks from tumor profiling (Yao et al., 2015; Silva et al., 2018), and used this ELMER tool to identify master regulatory TFs for the major molecular subtypes of esophageal cancer (Lin et al., 2018).
