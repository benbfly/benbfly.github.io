title: Global methylation loss patterns in aging and cancer

Most CpG dinucleotides are methylated at birth, but replication errors during life and especially in cancer lead to global hypomethylation of the genome. We are interested in how this loss of methylation allows expression of normally silenced genes and repetitive elements, and how these events can promote cancer or evoke an immune response. We provided the first comprehensive atlas of these methylation regions (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-018-0073-4" target="_blank">Zhou, Nature Genetics 2018</a>).

We uncovered how different CpGs lose methylation at different rates, and developed a deep learning model to predict these rates based on sequence context alone (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.08.16.504069" target="_blank">Zheng, bioRxiv 2022</a>), which allowed us to identify a set of cancer-specific changes and develop a computational tool (MMSeekR) to identify differences between different cancer types (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-023-03035-3" target="_blank">Zheng, Genome Biology 2023</a>). We are interested in how these changes predict response to immune therapies.
