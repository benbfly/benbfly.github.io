We collaborated with Peter Jonesâ€™ lab to use DNA Methyltransferase (DNMT) knockouts in colon cancer cells to study the effects of global methylation loss, showing dramatic changes in the epigenomic architecture of a large number of non-coding gene regulatory regions and expression of nearby genes (Lay et al., 2015). Turning to in vivo data, we recently compiled methylation data from ~15,000 publicly available tissue samples, and developed a new computational model to discover that Heterochromatin-Associated Methylation Loss begins early in life and behaves as a mitotic clock (Zhou et al., 2018).
