We collaborated with Peter Jonesâ€™ lab to use DNA Methyltransferase (DNMT) knockouts in colon cancer cells to study the effects of global methylation loss, showing dramatic changes in the epigenomic architecture of a large number of non-coding gene regulatory regions and expression of nearby genes (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.183368.114" target="_blank">Lay et al., <em>Genome Res.</em> 2015</a>). Turning to in vivo data, we recently compiled methylation data from ~15,000 publicly available tissue samples, and developed a new computational model to discover that Heterochromatin-Associated Methylation Loss begins early in life and behaves as a mitotic clock (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-018-0073-4" target="_blank">Zhou et al., <em>Nat. Genetics</em> 2018</a>).
