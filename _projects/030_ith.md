Tumors are not monolithic, and often have multiple subclones with different alterations. We are interested in how methylation changes allow different subclones to adapt to different functional constraints, especially immune evasion. We surveyed genomic methylation changes across subclones, and found that DNA methylation changes followed a similar evolutionary path as the genome in esophageal cancer (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ng.3683" target="_blank">Hao et al., <em>Nat. Genetics</em> 2016</a>), but were highly diverged in liver cancer (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-16-2822" target="_blank">Lin et al., <em>Cancer Res.</em>2017</a>).
By re-analyzing global methylation patterns in single-cell methylation datasets, we found that global methylation loss can be dramatically different in different subclones (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.08.16.504069" target="_blank">Zheng, bioRxiv 2022</a>), suggesting that immunogenic responses to global hypomethylation may by subclone specific.
