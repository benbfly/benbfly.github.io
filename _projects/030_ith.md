We collaborated with Phil Koefflerâ€™s lab to investigate the genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity of individual cancer cases by sequencing multiple geographic sites from the same tumour. In oesophageal cancer, we found that DNA methylation changes followed a similar evolutionary path as the genome (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ng.3683" target="_blank">Hao et al., <em>Nat. Genetics</em> 2016</a>), while we found significant divergence in liver cancer (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-16-2822" target="_blank">Lin et al., <em>Cancer Res.</em>2017</a>).
