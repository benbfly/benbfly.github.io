DNA from tumors circulates in the blood, and various DNA sequencing methods are being used for detection. We are using methylation patterns derived from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) whole-genome sequencing of native unamplified cell-free DNA (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.18.464684" target="_blank">Katsman et al., <em>bioRxiv</\em> 2021</a>).
