title: Characterizing tumor DNA in circulation using Oxford Nanopore sequencing

Cancer cells shed genomic DNA into circulation, and "liquid biopsies" are increasingly common to detect and characterize a tumor without an invasive biopsy of the tumor itself. We use Oxford Nanopore whole-genome sequencing, which allows us to characterize not only the DNA sequence but the DNA methylation patterns of the tumor DNA.

We showed that multiple complementary genomic features could be used to identify circulating tumor DNA (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-022-02710-1" target="_blank">Katsman, Genome Biology 2022</a>), which included characterization of methylation loss patterns. One of the major benefits of Nanopore sequencing is the ability to identify specific cell types using specific DNA methylation markers. We developed a leading method for deconvolution of cell types called CelFiE-ISH (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-024-03275-x" target="_blank">Unterman, Genome Biology 2024</a>), and are interested in advancing these techniques even further.
