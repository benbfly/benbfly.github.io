abstract = {Bisulfite treatment of {DNA} followed by high-throughput sequencing (Bisulfite-seq) is an important method for studying {DNA} methylation and epigenetic gene regulation, yet current software tools do not adequately address single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}). Identifying {SNPs} is important for accurate quantification of methylation levels and for identification of allele-specific epigenetic events such as imprinting. We have developed a model-based bisulfite {SNP} caller, Bis-{SNP}, that results in substantially better {SNP} calls than existing methods, thereby improving methylation estimates. At an average 30Ã— genomic coverage, Bis-{SNP} correctly identified 96\% of {SNPs} using the default high-stringency settings.

abstract = {{DNA} methylation and nucleosome positioning work together to generate chromatin structures that regulate gene expression. Nucleosomes are typically mapped using nuclease digestion requiring significant amounts of material and varying enzyme concentrations. We have developed a method ({NOMe}-seq) that uses a {GpC} methyltransferase (M.{CviPI}) and next generation sequencing to generate a high resolution footprint of nucleosome positioning genome-wide using less than 1 million cells while retaining endogenous {DNA} methylation information from the same {DNA} strand. Using a novel bioinformatics pipeline, we show a striking anti-correlation between nucleosome occupancy and {DNA} methylation at {CTCF} regions that is not present at promoters. We further show that the extent of nucleosome depletion at promoters is directly correlated to expression level and can accommodate multiple nucleosomes and provide genome-wide evidence that expressed non-{CpG} island promoters are nucleosome-depleted. Importantly, {NOMe}-seq obtains {DNA} methylation and nucleosome positioning information from the same {DNA} molecule, giving the first genome-wide {DNA} methylation and nucleosome positioning correlation at the single molecule, and thus, single cell level, that can be used to monitor disease progression and response to therapy.}

abstract = {Recent studies indicate that {DNA} methylation can be used to identify transcriptional enhancers, but no systematic approach has been developed for genome-wide identification and analysis of enhancers based on {DNA} methylation. We describe {ELMER} (Enhancer Linking by Methylation/Expression Relationships), an R-based tool that uses {DNA} methylation to identify enhancers and correlates enhancer state with expression of nearby genes to identify transcriptional targets. Transcription factor motif analysis of enhancers is coupled with expression analysis of transcription factors to infer upstream regulators. Using {ELMER}, we investigated more than 2,000 tumor samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We identified networks regulated by known cancer drivers such as {GATA3} and {FOXA1} (breast cancer), {SOX17} and {FOXA2} (endometrial cancer), and {NFE2L2}, {SOX2}, and {TP63} (squamous cell lung cancer). We also identified novel networks with prognostic associations, including {RUNX1} in kidney cancer. We propose {ELMER} as a powerful new paradigm for understanding the cis-regulatory interface between cancer-associated transcription factors and their functional target genes.}

abstract = {Extensive changes in {DNA} methylation are common in cancer and may contribute to oncogenesis through transcriptional silencing of tumor-suppressor genes. Genome-scale studies have yielded important insights into these changes but have focused on {CpG} islands or gene promoters. We used whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (bisulfite-seq) to comprehensively profile a primary human colorectal tumor and adjacent normal colon tissue at single-basepair resolution. Regions of focal hypermethylation in the tumor were located primarily at {CpG} islands and were concentrated within regions of long-range (\textgreater100 kb) hypomethylation. These hypomethylated domains covered nearly half of the genome and coincided with late replication and attachment to the nuclear lamina in human cell lines. We confirmed the confluence of hypermethylation and hypomethylation within these domains in 25 diverse colorectal tumors and matched adjacent tissue. We propose that widespread {DNA} methylation changes in cancer are linked to silencing programs orchestrated by the three-dimensional organization of chromatin within the nucleus.}

abstract = {The holistic role of {DNA} methylation in the organization of the cancer epigenome is not well understood. Here we perform a comprehensive, high-resolution analysis of chromatin structure to compare the landscapes of {HCT116} colon cancer cells and a {DNA} methylation-deficient derivative. The {NOMe}-seq accessibility assay unexpectedly revealed symmetrical and transcription-independent nucleosomal phasing across active, poised, and inactive genomic elements. {DNA} methylation abolished this phasing primarily at enhancers and {CpG} island ({CGI}) promoters, with little effect on insulators and non-{CGI} promoters. Abolishment of {DNA} methylation led to the context-specific reestablishment of the poised and active states of normal colon cells, which were marked in methylation-deficient cells by distinct {H3K27} modifications and the presence of either well-phased nucleosomes or nucleosome-depleted regions, respectively. At higher-order genomic scales, we found that long, {H3K9me3}-marked domains had lower accessibility, consistent with a more compact chromatin structure. Taken together, our results demonstrate the nuanced and context-dependent role of {DNA} methylation in the functional, multiscale organization of cancer epigenomes. \copyright 2015 Lay et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.}

abstract = {Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ({ESCC}) is among the most common malignancies, but little is known about its spatial intratumoral heterogeneity ({ITH}) and temporal clonal evolutionary processes. To address this, we performed multiregion whole-exome sequencing on 51 tumor regions from 13 {ESCC} cases and multiregion global methylation profiling for 3 of these 13 cases. We found an average of 35.8\% heterogeneous somatic mutations with strong evidence of {ITH}. Half of the driver mutations located on the branches of tumor phylogenetic trees targeted oncogenes, including {PIK3CA}, {NFE2L2} and {MTOR}, among others. By contrast, the majority of truncal and clonal driver mutations occurred in tumor-suppressor genes, including {TP53}, {KMT2D} and {ZNF750}, among others. Interestingly, phyloepigenetic trees robustly recapitulated the topological structures of the phylogenetic trees, indicating a possible relationship between genetic and epigenetic alterations. Our integrated investigations of spatial {ITH} and clonal evolution provide an important molecular foundation for enhanced understanding of tumorigenesis and progression in {ESCC}.}

abstract = {{DNA} methylation loss occurs frequently in cancer genomes, primarily within lamina-associated, late-replicating regions termed partially methylated domains ({PMDs}). We profiled 39 diverse primary tumors and 8 matched adjacent tissues using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing ({WGBS}) and analyzed them alongside 343 additional human and 206 mouse {WGBS} datasets. WeÂ identified a local {CpG} sequence context associated with preferential hypomethylation in {PMDs}. Analysis of {CpGs} in this context ('solo-{WCGWs}') identified previously undetected {PMD} hypomethylation in almost all healthy tissue types. {PMD} hypomethylation increased with age, beginning during fetal development, and appeared to track the accumulation of cell divisions. In cancer, {PMD} hypomethylation depth correlated with somatic mutation density and cell cycle gene expression, consistent with its reflection of mitotic history and suggesting its application as a mitotic clock. We propose that late replication leads to lifelong progressive methylation loss, which acts as a biomarker for cellular aging and which may contribute to oncogenesis.}

Our R/Bioconductor package {ELMER} (Enhancer Linking by Methylation/Expression Relationships) provides a systematic approach that reconstructs altered gene regulatory networks ({GRNs}) by combining enhancer methylation and gene expression data derived from the same sample set. Results: We present a completely revised version 2 of {ELMER} that provides numerous new features including an optional web-based interface and a new Supervised Analysis mode to use pre-defined sample groupings. We show that Supervised mode significantly increases statistical power and identifies additional {GRNs} and associated Master Regulators, such as {SOX11} and {KLF5} in Basal-like breast cancer.

abstract = {Understanding the intratumoral heterogeneity of hepatocellular carcinoma is instructive for developing personalized therapy and identifying molecular biomarkers. Here we applied whole-exome sequencing to 69 samples from 11 patients to resolve the genetic architecture of subclonal diversification. Spatial genomic diversity was found in all 11 hepatocellular carcinoma cases, with 29\% of driver mutations being heterogeneous, including {TERT}, {ARID1A}, {NOTCH2}, and {STAG2}. Similar with other cancer types, {TP53} mutations were always shared between all tumor regions, that is, located on the "trunk" of the evolutionary tree. In addition, we found that variants within several drug targets such as {KIT}, {SYK}, and {PIK3CA} were mutated in a fully clonal manner, indicating their therapeutic potentials for hepatocellular carcinoma. Temporal dissection of mutational signatures suggested that mutagenic processes associated with exposure to aristolochic acid and aflatoxin might play a more important role in early, as opposed to late, stages of hepatocellular carcinoma development. Moreover, we observed extensive intratumoral epigenetic heterogeneity in hepatocellular carcinoma based on multiple independent analytical methods and showed that intratumoral methylation heterogeneity might play important roles in the biology of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Our results also demonstrated prominent heterogeneity of intratumoral methylation even in a stable hepatocellular carcinoma genome. Together, these findings highlight widespread intratumoral heterogeneity at both the genomic and epigenomic levels in hepatocellular carcinoma and provide an important molecular foundation for better understanding the pathogenesis of this malignancy.

abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: Oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma ({OSCC}) and adenocarcinoma ({OAC}) are distinct cancers in terms of a number of clinical and epidemiological characteristics, complicating the design of clinical trials and biomarker developments. We analysed 1048 oesophageal tumour-germline pairs from both subtypes, to characterise their genomic features, and biological and clinical significance. {DESIGN}: Previously exome-sequenced samples were re-analysed to identify significantly mutated genes ({SMGs}) and mutational signatures. The biological functions of novel {SMGs} were investigated using cell line and xenograft models. We further performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation ({ChIP})-seq to characterise epigenetic alterations. {RESULTS}: {OSCC} and {OAC} displayed nearly mutually exclusive sets of driver genes, indicating that they follow independent developmental paths. The combined sample size allowed the statistical identification of a number of novel subtype-specific {SMGs}, mutational signatures and prognostic biomarkers. Particularly, we identified a novel mutational signature similar to Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer ({COSMIC})signature 16, which has prognostic value in {OSCC}. Two newly discovered {SMGs}, {CUL3} and {ZFP36L2}, were validated as important tumour-suppressors specific to the {OSCC} subtype. We further identified their additional loss-of-function mechanisms. {CUL3} was homozygously deleted specifically in {OSCC} and other squamous cell cancers ({SCCs}). Notably, {ZFP36L2} is associated with super-enhancer in healthy oesophageal mucosa; {DNA} hypermethylation in its super-enhancer reduced active histone markers in squamous cancer cells, suggesting an epigenetic inactivation of a super-enhancer-associated {SCC} suppressor. {CONCLUSIONS}: These data comprehensively contrast differences between {OSCC} and {OAC} at both genomic and epigenomic levels, and reveal novel molecular features for further delineating the pathophysiological mechanisms and treatment strategies for these cancers. \copyright Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.
